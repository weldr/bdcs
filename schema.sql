-- This describes the schema used by the metadata database (mddb).  We
-- considered several options for how to implement the mddb, finally deciding
-- upon sqlite (though, other relational databases would also be fine).  We
-- would like the mddb to eventually hold the data for multiple builds of each
-- package from many releases.  This could mean hundreds of millions of rows
-- needed to store the files.  Thus, the ability to work with a fairly large
-- database is important.
--
-- We evaluated document-based databases like mongodb but found it too slow and
-- a little unwieldy to use for our purposes.  We also evaluated key/value
-- systems like redis but found that accessing data was slow unless you add
-- your own index algorithm.  And if you're going to do that, you might as well
-- use something that already provides indexing.  Add sqlite's ubiquity and
-- the ability to move to another relational database if needed, and the
-- decision was made.
--
-- In general, the design of this database does not worry too much about
-- normal forms.  However, we do use a lot of intermediate tables to represent
-- one-to-many relationships as well as ensure that a piece of data only exists
-- in one place in the database.  Examples of these intermediate tables are
-- the various *_files tables and the *_key_values tables.
--
-- At the same time, we have sought to not overload the database with tons of
-- unnecessary tables.  That is why there is the key_val table and all the
-- associated *_key_values tables.  There are lots of pieces of data at all
-- levels (builds, files, etc.) that only exist for a handful of items.
-- Alternately, there are pieces of data that exist with a wide range of
-- possible values.  The generic key_val table allows storing this kind of
-- data without making too much of a mess.

-- A project is the database's representation of some upstream that produces
-- a piece of software.  This could be as simple as a tarball that gets built
-- into a single RPM, or as complicated as a live OS image, or anything in
-- between.  We don't impose any restrictions here on what kind of thing a
-- project can be.
--
-- Starting with this table, we split NEVRA-style information up between here,
-- sources, and builds because it makes sense to do so.  At each level, we only
-- store information that does not change between instances of that level.  For
-- instance, this table stores the name.  All sources released from a given
-- project will have the same name, as will all builds created from those
-- sources.
--
-- At any one time, there will only be one row in this table for a single
-- project.  It does not make sense to have several instances.

-- This is one of the largest tables in the metadata database - the one that
-- stores a row for every file that has been imported.  This table stores
-- everything required for recreating a file on disk with the right path and
-- permissions, except for the contents of the file.  This is the metadata
-- database.  The contents live in the content store.
--
-- It is possible that a single file exists in multiple compilation units
-- (packages, for instance).  Thus, the relationship between a file and what
-- contains it must be in some other table.  See build_files for more
-- information.
--
-- It is also possible (and in fact, likely) that a single file will exist in
-- multiple builds.  Consider two builds of the same source - it is likely that
-- many of the files will be identical, and that only some will change in any
-- meaningful way.  It would be nice if we could reduce duplication and only
-- store a new row for a single file when it had real changes.  Alas, a file
-- that is identical across two builds will still have a different mtime.
--
-- Thus (for now), each new build imported will result in rows for all its file
-- being created again.

-- by the content store (and would cause problems with identitcal files across
-- multiple builds if it did), and user/group, since those are stored here as

--   allows keeping track of what group of RPMs came from a given build without
--   needing extra tables that only make sense sometimes.
-- * Associating files with an RPM.  For similar reasons, we use the key/value
--   pairing to keep track of which files make up which RPM.
-- * Keeping track of rpm-provide data.
