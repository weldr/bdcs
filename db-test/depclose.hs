-- This program takes a database and an RPM name (or a list of RPMs) and returns
-- a list of all the dependencies of that RPM.  If multiple RPMs are provided, it
-- handles each one separately - not as several packages as part of a whole.
--
-- This program does not attempt to do dependency solving.  It simply gathers up
-- everything that a package says it depends on, and everything that all those
-- say that depend on, and so forth.  If there's a problem (dependency is not
-- present in the database, versions are incorrect, etc.) this program will not
-- error out.  It is up to the caller to do the solving and figure problems
-- out.
--
-- If a dependency can be satisfied in multiple ways, this program should grab
-- all possibilities and all their dependencies.  In general, any decisions about
-- the best way to solve something is handled by the caller.
--
-- Limitations:
--
-- * Should handle multiple RPMs as part of the same "transaction".
-- * Doesn't know why a dependency got pulled in, but maybe that should be left up
--   to the caller as well.
-- * Attempts to handle versions on Requires: but perhaps doesn't do a good job
--   of that.  This needs more thorough testing.
-- * Should handle all the other kinds of dependencies, after we start putting
--   those into the database.
-- * Has not been tested against more complicated cases (packages that can have a
--   dep satisfied two different ways, lang packs, multilib, etc.).
-- * Has not been shown to give the same results as yum/dnf.
